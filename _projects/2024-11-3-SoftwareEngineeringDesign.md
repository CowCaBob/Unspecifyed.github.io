### Project Synopsis

This project is a component of my CS410 class and centers on reverse engineering a banking application to comprehend its internal architecture, operation, and security attributes. The entire project is available on GitHub: [Bank App Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/Unspecifyed/cs410ProjectBankAppReverseEngneering).

### Synopsis

In this project, I conducted an analysis and reverse engineering of a banking application. Essential elements comprise:

- **Disassembly and Code Analysis**: Deconstructed the binary to analyze functions and logic in the absence of the original source code.
- **Security Evaluation**: Detected possible vulnerabilities and security issues, including inadequate encryption and insufficient input validation.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: Recorded the reverse engineering procedure, encompassing discoveries, employed methodologies, and suggested enhancements for app security.

This project demonstrates my expertise in binary analysis, code disassembly, and security-oriented reverse engineering, showcasing my capacity to evaluate software for functionality and security improvements.
